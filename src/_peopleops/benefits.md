## Family and Friends Days

Inspired by GitLab's [Family and Friends Day](https://about.gitlab.com/company/family-and-friends-day/), Meltano has made Family and Friends Day a regular part of the culture. 
On these days, we will close the doors to the Meltano virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a publicly visible shutdown.

Team members can share about their Family and Friends Day in the #family-and-friends-day Slack channel after the event, or publicly on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever they're most comfortable using the hashtag #FamilyFriends1st. 
Sharing is optional. 
Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it.

### Upcoming Family and Friends Days

* 2021-08-20 - The first Meltano Family & Friends Day
* 2021-09-17
* 2021-10-15
* 2021-11-24

These dates are tracked in the [Team Meetings Calendar](/handbook/#calendars). 
Meltano employees should mark these days off using [PTO by Roots](/handbook/tech-stack/#pto-by-roots).

In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Meltano Team Members to continue to take additional days off, as needed. 
Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.

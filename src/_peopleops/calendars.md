## Requesting time

Meltano values asynchronous and inclusive conversations whereever possible. There are also times when we may still want to schedule time with each other. This applies when scheduling time with external partners or vendors, when scheduling 1:1s, or when setting up time to discuss critical decisions.

Whenever requesting another team member's time, but _especially_ if you can see that they are busy or out of their normal working hours, the person requesting the time should take responsibility for communicating clearly and proactively on the following points:

1. Specify if the meeting will be recorded or can be recorded.
2. Clearly note on the invite who is "required" vs "optional".
3. Proactively initiate a scheduling conversation in Slack, if required. (As described below.)

### Being mindful of others' conflicts

As a requestor, if you are booking a meeting where anyone in the "required" list is marked **not available** (due to time off, working hours, or other conflicts), it is polite practice to proactively initiate a conversation: "I see I am inviting you at a time where you are already blocked. Can you attend?" along with the following important details in the body of the invite, or in a slack direct message:

1. Give context to why the meeting is being booked over a blocked time. (Example: "this was the only time I could find before I leave for vacation", or "this was the best time I could find given everyone's schedule", or "because Company X is in Alaska, we had to schedule a late evening meeting")
2. Describe the next-best options if they not able to join. (Can the meeting proceed without them? Would the meeting get rescheduled? Would it be canceled? Could a recording be added? etc.)

Above is a best practice, but such conversations will will sometimes missed inadvertantly. In that case, the invitee with a conflict can simply inform the organizer that their calendar is blocked at that time, providing a short description of the block, and in turn may request "context and guidance" given the identified conflict. The request for "context and guidance" can be inferred to be shorthand for all of the above information described in the bullets above.

This context and guidance plays an important role in work-life balance for our fellow team members, providing the person with the conflict helpful input on whether and at what cost they should consider changes to their existing plans - for instance: changing their wakeup time, hiring a babysitter, canceling other meetings, etc.

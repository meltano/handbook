## Tracking Time Off

Holidays, Family and Friend Days, and Paid Time Off (PTO) are all tracked via [PTO by Roots](/company/tech-stack/#pto-by-roots).

### Short-term Leave

In [PTO by Roots](/company/tech-stack/#pto-by-roots), there are several options for indicating time off. 
For any time that you need off, whether it's a vacation, personal time, personal illnes, family illness, etc., use the "Paid Time Off" option type in the "Short-term leave" list. 
You may optionally indicate what the OOO is for as a way for your manager, co-workers, and the community to better understand your availability. 

For Public Holidays, use the "Public Holidays" OOO type and indicate the holiday in the description field. 

[Family and Friends days](/peopleops/benefits#family-and-friends-day) are considered PTO and should be indicated using the "Paid Time Off" option.
If your PTO includes a Family and Friends Day, there is no need to create a separate event for the day. 

### Long-term Leave

Extended leave should be indicated using the available options in OOO type listing. 
Be sure to coordinate with your manager as you plan to take this time off.

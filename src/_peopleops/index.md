## Hiring Process

We're currently using [Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.io/) to manage the hiring process and referrals. All employees should have an account.

### Adding New Roles

- Open an issue in the [administration](https://github.com/meltano/administration/issues) repository using the `new-job-creation.md` template.
- Fill out necessary details. All sections are required unless they're marked optional. Having all of this information helps us get the job online and ensures all candidates are evaluated based on the same interview process. This is just an initial version of the hiring process -- it can always be iterated on.
- A Site Admin will add the role to Greenhouse once the issue has been filled out and approved.
- Site Admin will add the hiring manager as a job admin to this role.
- Hiring manager will be responsible for screening candidates, setting up interviews, and moving them through the pipeline.

### Referrals

- Log into Greenhouse
- Click the green "Add a Referral" button
- Fill out the candidate details and attach a copy of their resume and cover letter if you have them.

### Candidates from GitLab

We can not and will not recruit candidates who work at GitLab.  Should someone from GitLab approach us regarding an open position, they will be treated the same as any other candidate.

### Discussing candidates in Slack

It is okay to reference first names and job titles for candidates in the private `hiring` Slack channel. However, please do not post feedback.

### Greenhouse Administration

#### Adding New Users

Add users [here](https://app4.greenhouse.io/account/users?status=active). Hiring managers can be added as "Job Admin" for
a specific role. Other users can be added as "Basic" users and not added to any roles. This will allow them to make referrals.

- **Basic User:** Can add referrals to open roles or manage interviews they've been assigned to.
- **Job admins:** Can control the interview process for a specific role.
- **Site Admins:** Can add new roles, see all candidate info, see and modify roles, and manage the job board settings.

#### Configure Job Introductions/Conclusions

By default, all job posts have an introduction and a conclusion that tells the applicant about Meltano and our benefits.

To configure these:

- Visit the [Job Board configuration page](https://app4.greenhouse.io/jobboard)
- Click the three dot menu next to the job board you want to configure
- Select "Edit Post Settings"
- Change the introduction and conclusion as needed

Please note: These settings are per job board. If there are multiple job boards you'll need to update this setting for
each one.
## Employee Promotion Policy

When possible, Meltano seeks to promote from within. Our Employee Promotion Policy sets the general guidelines for these promotions.

### Eligibility for Promotion

Employees are eligible for a promotion after they have been with the company for at least 90 days and are not currently on a performance improvement plan.

### Promotion Criteria

Employees are promoted based on their performance and their workplace conduct.

   - Performance - Employee has demonstrated heightened performance on a consistent basis over time.
   - Value alignment - Employee conducts themselves in a way that is aligned with [company values](https://handbook.meltano.com/company/values) and sets an example for others to follow.

### Promotion Process

   - Manager should identify an opportunity for promotion, either by filing a current opening or determining a new role should be created.
   - Manager to discuss the desired promotion with HR, being sure to ask about the new salary range and any new/additional benefits.
      - Performance and value alignment should be well documented in Lattice for HR and manager to review.
      - New salary range will be determined by HR according to our [compensation policy](https://handbook.meltano.com/peopleops/compensation#salary)
  - HR will present the proposed promotion to CEO to obtain approval.
   - Following approval, Manager will meet with employee to discuss the exciting news.

## Financial operations

Financial operations includes spending company money, guidelines, and the reimbursement policy.

### Spending company money

We expect Meltano team members to take responsibility to determine what they need to purchase or expense in order to do their jobs effectively. We don't want you to have to wait with getting the items that you need to get your job done. You most likely know better than anyone else what the items are that you need to be successful in your job.

### Guidelines

1. Spend company money like it is your **own** money, but please make decisions with the company's best interest in mind.
1. You don't have to [ask permission](https://m.signalvnoise.com/if-you-ask-for-my-permission-you-wont-have-my-permission-9d8bb4f9c940) before making purchases **in the interest of the company**. When in doubt, do **inform** your manager prior to the purchase, or as soon as possible after the purchase.
1. It is generally easiest and fastest for you to make any purchases for office supplies yourself and expense them. If you are unable to pay for any supplies yourself, please reach out to your manager or the Operations Analyst to ask that they make the purchase on your behalf.
1. You may privately use Meltano property (e.g. MacBook), to check your private e-mails, or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm Meltano, or interfere with Intellectual Property.
1. Any purchase that will cost Meltano $1000 USD per item (or over) is classed as company property.  Any such items will need to be tracked by Operations.
   1. After an approved purchase, the item description and serial number will need to be provided to the Head of Operations.  One good way to do this is via the notes section in an expense report.
   2. You will be required to return these item(s) if you leave the company.
3. Any non-company expenses should not be paid for with a company credit card.
4. If team members submit expenses for reimbursement for personal purchases that are not covered in the expense policy, this is a violation of our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics.

### Reimbursement policy

1. Purchases of at least $10 USD require a receipt.
1. Employees should file expense reports in the same month that the purchase was made. Contractors should include receipts with their invoices.
1. To be reimbursed for company expenses, please submit a report in [Expensify](/company/tech-stack/#expensify) (all team members). Non-US team members will also submit a report in Remote.

#### US team member reimbursement process

1. Upload receipts in Expensify and submit a report. Please use the appropriate tags/categories and include comments when appropriate. If a tag/category is missing, you may be asked to edit your report.
1. Team members in the US will be automatically reimbursed through Expensify after their report is "final approved."

#### Non-US team member reimbursement process

Although non-US team members will not receive reimbursement through Expensify, the company needs to have a single source of truth for expenses. So, all team members will need to use Expensify. You'll then submit an additional report in Remote to receive reimbursement.

1. Upload receipts in Expensify and submit a report. Please use the appropriate tags/categories and include comments when appropriate. If a tag/category is missing, you may be asked to edit your report.
1. Once the Expensify report is approved, create an expense in [Remote](/company/tech-stack/#remote) referencing the Expensify report number and matching its full amount.
1. The approved expense amount will be deposited in your account with your monthly salary.

### Office equipment and supplies

The company will reimburse for the following items if you **need it for work or use it mainly for business**, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring payroll taxes. Please keep in mind that while the amounts below are guidelines and not strict limits, any purchase (other than a laptop) that will cost Meltano $1000 USD per item (or over) will require prior approval from your manager.

The below averages are what Meltano **usually** reimburses. If you prefer to spend more on a given item, that's okay considering the average price. You are also welcome to expense the `Meltano Average Price in USD` portion, and cover the rest with personal funds. For example, if you purchase a high-end Steelcase ergonomic chair, you are welcome to expense the average price per the table below and cover the rest with personal funds. We are encouraging our members to use their best judgment when spending the company's money.

When reimbursing through Expensify please select "reimbursable" for the portion which Meltano will be covering, and add a note explaining the receipt difference.

Team members should not use a Corporate Credit Card to purchase office equipment for their personal workspace. All office equipment purchases for a team member's personal workspace should be made on a personal credit card and expensed.

#### Setting up a home office for the first time?

Meltano team members are encouraged to create a comfortable, ergonomic workspace. Please do research to find a chair, desk, and other equipment that facilitate good posture and healthy habits.

#### Software

1. We do not issue Microsoft Office 365 licenses, as Meltano uses [Google Workspace](/company/tech-stack/#google-workspace)
   (Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc.) instead.

##### Individual subscriptions

Meltano does not reimburse individual software subscriptions (e.g. Apple Music, Krisp, etc.).

###### Subscription exceptions

Certain types of individual subscriptions are reimbursable, such as VPN service. If you are uncertain whether a particular service is reimbursable, please contact the Operations.

#### Hardware

It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Please use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask your teammates.

If you wish to go over the recommended reimbursement, this is an exception and should first be raised with your manager and if supported, should be raised with the Operations Analyst who will review and respond to the request.

The technology price guidelines are based on acquiring products in the United States. Meltano understands prices may vary based on location. If the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be within the above price guidance.

#### Travel

Meltano will reimburse you for business travel expenses when you need to travel to represent the company.
All trips need to be approved of in advance by your manager.
Employees seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses.

##### Upgrades
Meltano will only pay for economy class travel.  If you exceed `188cm` or `6'2"` in height you may:
- Expense the full cost of an upgrade to a seat with more leg room in the standard economy cabin. These seats are often marketed as, "Economy Plus", "Comfort+", or "Main Cabin Extra".
- Expense up to the first $300 USD for an upgrade to Business Class or Premium Economy on flights longer than 8 hours.

If your height does not meet the above cm/inch requirement, and you feel unsafe to travel, you may:
- Expense up to the first $100 USD for an upgrade to a seat with more leg room on flights longer than 8 hours.  These seats are often marketed as, "Economy Plus", "Comfort+", or "Main Cabin Extra".
- Review seating options with your manager (keeping in mind the guidance on "spending company money like it is your own")

##### Working while traveling

If you plan to work while at the airport, we will reimburse lounge access up to $50 for airport stays of at least 2 hours.
If you plan to work during the flight, we will reimburse in-flight WiFi up to $30 for flights of at least 2 hours.

##### Non-reimbursable items
Items that will not be reimbursed include the following:
- Airline club or lounge memberships or enhanced airport services such as TSApre, CLEAR, Global Entry, NEXUS.
- Airline or train ticket upgrades from economy class. If you are taller than 180cm/6ft, you can upgrade to get extra leg room.
- Child care, babysitting, house-sitting, pet-walking or pet-sitting/kennel charges.
- Costs incurred by traveler's failure to cancel travel or hotel reservations in a timely fashion.
- Passports, vaccinations and visas when not required as a specific and necessary condition of the travel assignment.
- Personal entertainment expenses, including in-flight movies, headsets, health club facilities, hotel pay-per-view movies, in-theater movies, social activities and related incidental costs.
- Travel accident insurance premiums or purchase of additional travel insurance.

Should you have any question about whether an expense is reimbursable, please ask Operations or your manager prior to incurring the expense.

## Tools and technology

### Tech stack

View the [complete list](/company/tech-stack) of our tech stack.

### Laptop configurations

Meltano approves the use of macOS and Linux. Meltano prohibits the use of Microsoft Windows for the following reasons:

- While there have been security issues with all operating systems, due to the popularity of the Windows operating system it is the main platform targeted by attackers with spyware, viruses, and ransomware.
- macOS is pre-loaded onto Apple hardware.
  Linux is free.
  To take advantage of the features in Windows as a business, Meltano would have to purchase Windows Pro licensing as these business features are not available on Windows Home Edition.
  As many purchases of laptops have occurred with employees making the purchases and then being reimbursed by Meltano, a remote employee would typically be making a purchase of a laptop pre-loaded with Windows Home Edition.
- Windows Home Edition is notoriously [hard to secure](https://www.markloveless.net/blog/2019/1/15/dealing-with-windows-10).

To standardize the hardware provisioned for Meltano team members, the following Apple hardware option is highly recommended:

- [MacBook Pro 14" / 512gig SSD / 32gig RAM / Apple M1 Pro with 10-core CPU, 14-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch)
- [MacBook Pro - 16" / 512gig SSD / 32gigs RAM / Apple M1 Pro with 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch)

Note that the above links are to the Apple store website for the United States. These particular configurations are not available in Apple Stores, so will need to be ordered online. If you are located in a different country, you will likely have to place your order from your regional Apple store website.

Additionally, do not purchase Apple Care.

If alternate hardware is required, please request it during the onboarding process.  It can be provisioned on a case-by-case basis.  With that in mind, the MacBook Air has been found to be insufficient for our needs.  Requests for this model will not be approved.

### Calendars

Please see the [Calendars](calendars) page for a list of company calendars.

## GitHub workflow best practices

We use [GitHub](/company/tech-stack/#github) for project management across the organization. Whether you work in engineering or marketing, GitLab will be the central tool for collaboration and delivery. To ensure end-to-end visibility and asynchronous communication, we use epics, issues, and merge requests to organize our work.

As you work within GitHub, please be sure to follow these best practices:

1. Directly mention (`@username`) the people you want to involve in a comment, especially the person you're replying to. Some people only work through GitHub todos (rather than email notifications), and therefore, they will only see responses to comments/threads if they're explicitly mentioned.
1. If an issue is blocked or waiting for someone's action, the issue should be assigned to those individuals.
1. Include all relevant information, including labels, milestones, due dates, and details.
1. Provide updates in a comment to document progress.

## Benefits and perks

## Business operations

### Calendar quarters

Use calendar quarters (e.g. 2021-Q4) rather than fiscal quarters (e.g. FY22-Q4) when discussing time.

### Address and Phone Numbers

Meltano's incorporation and mailing address can be found in the Shared 1Password vault item called `Meltano Address`.

Meltano's phone number can be found in the Shared 1Password vault item called `Meltano Phone Number`.

### Verification of Employment

All verifications of employment (VOE’s) should go through the Human Resource department and should be done via email. These include but are not limited to requests from government agencies, mortgage lenders, prospective employers and others.

Meltano will comply with all government requests for verification of employment.

Meltano will respond to requests from mortgage lenders, landlords and the like, if the request is accompanied by a release form from the employee. Additionally, employees should notify Human Resources through email that a request may be forthcoming.

Prospective employers and those with collection agencies and others will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Meltano will under no circumstances provide wage information to a non government agency without consent and a release from the employee. Prospective employers will only receive verification of dates of employment and title.

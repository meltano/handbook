## Issue Trackers

At Meltano, we use GitLab issues to track everything that needs to (one day) be done or discussed.
Find the appropriate tracker for your issue below.

In line with our [Transparency](https://meltano.com/docs/#transparency) value, most of these trackers and the issues they hold are public so that our entire community can participate.
If an issue fits best in a public tracker but should be private anyway, use a [confidential issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html).

### General

- [Meta (`meltano/meta`)](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meta/-/issues): Public issue tracker for **meta-level topics** around the team, company, or community that don't concern a specific [product](#product-specific) and don't fit in any other project. Use confidential issues as needed.
- [Handbook (`meltano/handbook`)](https://gitlab.com/meltano/handbook/-/issues): Public issue tracker for **process and policy proposals** that will be documented in the public [company handbook](https://handbook.meltano.com/). Use confidential issues as needed.

### Subject-specific

- [Administration (`meltano/administration`)](https://gitlab.com/meltano/administration/-/issues): Private issue tracker for **administrative tasks** related to running the business. Used primarily by CEO and Operations Analyst.
- [Hiring (`meltano/hiring`)](https://gitlab.com/meltano/hiring/-/issues): Private issue tracker for **hiring topics**: hiring plans, job openings, and interview processes. Repository contains processes, questions, and exercises.
- [Marketing (`meltano/marketing/marketing-general`)](https://gitlab.com/meltano/marketing/marketing-general/-/issues): Public issue tracker for **all things marketing**. Use confidential issues as needed.

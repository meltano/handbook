## New-Hire Onboarding Procedures

### Pre-Join Welcome and Prep

#### Join the `#waiting-room` channel

Upon an offer being formally accepted, new employees will be added to the `#waiting-room` Slack channel. This channel is dedicated to asking pre-onboarding questions and providing a friendly welcoming area for team members to say hello. (New hires are not added to other `#internal-*` channels until the start date.)

### After Joining

_This is not intended to be a full list of onboarding steps. Please see your onboarding issue (described below) for a complete list of onboarding steps._

#### Onboarding Issue Checklist

New Meltano employees will have an onboarding issue created for them in Gitlab, with a list of actions to be performed upon joining. (Onboarding action items may differ slightly across teams.)

#### Read the Handbook

You should block a couple days to read the entire handbook, focusing on sections pertaining to your particular team and role.

**Tip: You may elect to just immediately start a new branch in the Handbook repo for any changes you run into during your onboarding process.**

#### Your Onboarding Buddy

When you join Meltano, your hiring manager will assign an onboarding buddy for you. Your buddy may be a team member in a similar job function (esp. engineer roles) or it could be a person in a completely different team and job title. Your onboarding buddy will be your first point of contact whenever you have questions that are not easily answerable in the Handbook or your other onboarding materials. You should immediately book time with your buddy in your first week, and feel free to ping them directly or call on them if you are stuck.

We encourage you to start and/or recap these conversations into the `#onboarding` channel, and create a Handbook MR where applicable to share back what you have learned.

_Note: The role of onboarding buddy may require up to 4-6 hours per week over the first two weeks. Managers and buddies should consider this time investment and adjust expectations on their weekly deliverables as appropriate._

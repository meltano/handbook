## Brand Personality

Our personality is built around five main characteristics:

- **Human**: We write like we talk. We avoid buzzwords and jargon, and instead communicate simply, clearly, and honestly.
- **Competent**: We aim to be masterly at what we offer, and communicate with conviction.
- **Humble**: We care about helping those around us achieve great things more than we care about our personal accomplishments.
- **Inclusive**: We embrace new ideas, new voices, and new perspectives. We are always happy to be educated.
- **Fun**: We like Shramp and other oddities. We appreciate whimsical, curious, and delightful moments.

## Meet Melty the Dragon

As the Regional Fire Chief, Melty prioritized the efficiency and collaboration of their district teams. Feeling frustrated with the current state of their data stack, Melty had trouble determining how to get the most out of the department’s data. Seeking a seamless solution, Melty found Meltano, and after working together for a couple of years, we developed an undeniable connection. Melty asked all the right questions and drove us to make better products and documentation so they could thrive in their pursuit of perpetual learning and improvement.

Melty the Meltano Dragon will melt your heart with its curious and adventurous nature.

### Melty personality:

Melty is friendly, kind, and empathetic. Melty loves creating delightful moments and bringing people together. The best parties are the dinner parties that Melty hosts every month.

Melty is approachable and wants to use their skills for good.

### Why a dragon/ Why Melty:

We selected a dragon as our mascot, because dragons are mythical, strong, enduring, and can be fierce but also cute. They are not afraid of challenges, and they approach obstacles with honor, confidence, intelligence, and enthusiasm. We appreciate that they are “imaginary” and spark a sense of curiosity and the pursuit of the unknown. We imagine a better way forward in the data space and the future of work and that optimism and belief is mirrored in our conviction in Melty the dragon.

## Tone of Voice

We communicate to be understood most broadly. As a global company with an international workforce and community, we use language that is, first and foremost, clear and devoid of jargon, slang, and acronyms when possible.

While we are highly competent in our industry, we use language and terminology that is comprehensible by the broadest audience. Our goal is to educate, inform, and welcome others with the information we have. This goes back to our open source ethos, core desire to support a broad community, and mission to enable everyone to realize the full potential of their data.

Another facet of being our most intelligible selves is consistently building our authenticity and trustworthiness. This builds over time with every interaction and all prose and content we put out into the world. We are thoughtful, truthful, and transparent in our comms and interactions.

We communicate and interact as much as possible in a conversational tone and demeanour. The goal is always to open up discussions and opportunities for education. We have a continuous open invitation for discussion and our casual tone helps build a sense of camaraderie.

You're encouraged to have fun and to celebrate the community. We want to help champion this industry and wins. There is always room for authentic celebration and excitement.

Lastly, all of this only matters if we are consistent in our approach. Consistency is key to building the comprehensive brand voice and tone we strive to achieve.

## A Quick Guide to Meltano

### Overview (75 words):

Meltano (https://meltano.com) is the open source DataOps OS that bridges the gap between DevOps and the modern data stack. It lets data teams manage all their data tools in one place and treat their entire data platform like a coherent internal software product, unlocking best practices such as version control and CI/CD that enable more effective collaboration and rapid iteration to meet the ever-evolving needs of the organization so it can keep its data edge.

### Why now:

The modern data stack continues to expand, and the lack of infrastructure tooling to manage the increasing complexity leaves organizations unable to move fast and make the most of their data. Software development best practices such as DevOps provide many answers, but cannot be applied directly to a set of tools held together by ad-hoc integrations (i.e. duct tape).

### Differentiation:

Meltano was founded inside GitLab, who build the leading open source DevOps platform, and spun out in 2021 by its first engineering manager and data lead. Building an open source developer tool in constant collaboration with a thriving community of contributors is in their DNA, and they see the parallels between data engineering and software development and the opportunity to bridge them more clearly than anyone else.

For community calls use one of the Meltano-branded backgrounds. These are available through Zoom's background settings. You can find the latest artwork for these images on the [Marketing Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e88OE-AhMqcZ5pw9WUI8ssOe_RMej8QI).

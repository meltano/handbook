Welcome to Meltano marketing.

## Weekly Community Activities

The Meltano convenes regularly to generate content for community and learning purposes.

These items include:

- **Office Hours**: Community meeting for discussion about upcoming features and general Q&A
- **Demo Day**: Community meeting every other Thursday showing off what has shipped, demonstrated by each authoring participant as available
- **Meltano / SDK Release**: the actual software release, which generates a changelog, version number, and all of the previous content for the week

Each item (linked below) has a corresponding guide to promoting that activity. Each week should roughly follow the following content schedule:

| Day       | Content                                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monday    | Release blog & promotion |
| Tuesday   | Social promotion of weekly activity                       |
| Wednesday | Social promotion of weekly activity                       |
| Thursday  | Thursday release blog & promotion, weekly newsletter      |
| Friday    | Demo day blog & promotion                                 |

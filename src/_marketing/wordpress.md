## Images
### Optimization
When uploading images to the website it is important to ensure that they are optimized for this medium in order to ensure quick navigation for everyone who visits our site and just as a best practice in general. This means compressing the original size of your image to make it load faster (preferably to less than 1MB). If you are unable to perform this action before uploading, or would just like to optimize existing images, you can use the [Robin Image Optimizer](https://robinoptimizer.com) WordPress plugin.
### Using Robin Image Optimizer
With our current license, we can optimize up to 5,000 images per month. To compress or optimize bulk images:
1. Login to WordPress.
2. Go to Settings > Robin image optimizer.
3. Select the correct optimization server, which is "Premium - no limits".
4. Click on "Optimize" and keep this page open until a bulk optimization is successfully performed.

**Alternatively, if you'd like to compress single images, you can:**
1. Login to WordPress.
2. Go to Media > Library.
3. Click on the "Optimize" button next to the image you'd like to compress.

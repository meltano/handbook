## Domains and Responsibilities

The data team sits within the Product organization so the primary responsibility is to use data to inform product decisions.
A secondary responsibility of the team is to provide insights into the health of the business and open source ecosystem around it.


## Code and Repository Ownership

The data team is responsible for the following code bases:
- [squared](https://gitlab.com/meltano/squared) - An internal Meltano project that is used for Dogfooding the product while also serving as the primary data platform for the team.
- [snowplow-infra](https://gitlab.com/meltano/snowplow-infra) - The infrastructure-as-code for the data team's (Snowplow)[https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow] instance, used for collecting telemetry data.

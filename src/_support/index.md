## Slack Support

Support on Slack is primarily provided by the community, but we strive to answer all questions within 1 business day. The [#support](https://meltano.slack.com/archives/C029CUM7ATD) Slack channel is where Meltano team members can request support from the wider team. If you see a support request that needs an assist, please share the relevant Slack thread in this channel.

### Process

- The DevRel team checks `#troubleshooting`, `#getting-started`, `#contributing`, and `#support` in the morning to see if there are unanswered questions we can help with.
- Questions that require engineering support are dropped into `#support` and a subject matter expert (SME) is tagged. If a SME isn't known, tag `@meltano-engineering`.
- Once a request has been handled please add a âœ… emoji to the thread to let the team know that it's covered.
- If the issue is related to our docs (or lackthereof) please open an issue or a PR to address the issue.

## Email

Emails to `support@meltano.com` forward to HubSpot so they can be triaged, assigned, and managed. These are currently routed to `@Amanda Folson` and `@Douwe Maan`.

### Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

Emails to `security@meltano.com` also forward to HubSpot, and are automatically assigned the Security Issue category.
As documented in our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://meltano.com/docs/responsible-disclosure.html), we will acknowledge receipt of a vulnerability report the next business day and strive to send the reporter regular updates about our progress.

## HubSpot Live Chat

The [Meltano.com website](https://www.meltano.com) is set up with live chat powered by HubSpot. Live chats are piped into `#support` on Slack and can be replied to within a thread. These are currently routed to `@Amanda Folson`. We try to respond to these within 1 business day.

## GitHub Issues/PRs

The DevRel team tries to respond to issues and PRs created by the community within 24 hours. New PRs and issues across Meltano projects are posted to `#meltano-repo-activity`, `#hub-repo-activity`, and `#sdk-repo-activity` while Singer ecosystem are posted to `#singer-ecosystem-activity` on Slack. There is no SLA on Singer ecosystem issues and PRs, but we try to respond when there's something we think we can assist with.

### Process

- The DevRel team checks `#meltano-repo-activity`, `#hub-repo-activity`, and `#sdk-repo-activity` in the morning to see if there are new issues or PRs without a response.
- Thank the user for their contribution and let them know that someone on the team will review it shortly.
- Drop a link to the issue or PR in `#engineering-chatter` for triage and review.

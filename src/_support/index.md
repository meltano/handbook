## Customer Support

### Email

Emails to `hello@meltano.com` forward to Zendesk so they can be triaged, assigned, and managed.

#### Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

Emails to `security@meltano.com` also forward to Zendesk, and are automatically assigned to the Security group, which includes all current team members.
As documented in our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://meltano.com/docs/responsible-disclosure.html), we will acknowledge receipt of a vulnerability report the next business day and strive to send the reporter regular updates about our progress.

### Intercom Live Chat

The [Meltano.com website](https://www.meltano.com) is set up with live chat powered by Intercom.

### Statement of Support

This section covers what we support in terms of Meltano and its related components. Since Meltano takes a modular approach to data engineering, where a Meltano project may be composed of plugins of different types, it's also important to define what is out of the scope of support.

In general, we will provide support for issues that are within the Meltano context. For example, we will support Docker-based Meltano installations, but we won't dig deep into issues with Docker itself. Similarly, we'll support configuring and running plugins that Meltano supports out of the box, but troubleshooting custom plugins would generally be considered out of scope.

#### Version Support
 
We support the current major version and one prior major version. The prior major version is supported for a period of 6 months after release of the newer major version.

#### Out of Scope

- Debugging custom plugins

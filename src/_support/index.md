## Slack Support

Support on Slack is primarily provided by the community, but we strive to answer all questions within 24 hours. The [#support](https://meltano.slack.com/archives/C029CUM7ATD) Slack channel is where Meltano team members can request support from the wider team. If you see a support request that needs an assist, please share the relevant Slack thread in this channel.

Once a request has been handled please add a âœ… emoji to the thread to let the team know that it's covered.

## Email

Emails to `support@meltano.com` forward to HubSpot so they can be triaged, assigned, and managed.

### Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

Emails to `security@meltano.com` also forward to Zendesk, and are automatically assigned to the Security group, which includes all current team members.
As documented in our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://meltano.com/docs/responsible-disclosure.html), we will acknowledge receipt of a vulnerability report the next business day and strive to send the reporter regular updates about our progress.

## HubSpot Live Chat

The [Meltano.com website](https://www.meltano.com) is set up with live chat powered by HubSpot. Live chats are piped into #support on Slack and can be replied to within a thread. These are currently routed to `@Amanda Folson`. Pre-sales questions or RFPs are sent to `@Douwe Maan`.

## GitHub Issues/PRs

We try to respond to issues and PRs created by the community within 24 hours. New PRs and issues across Meltano projects and the Singer ecosystem are posted to #singer-ecosystem-activity on Slack.

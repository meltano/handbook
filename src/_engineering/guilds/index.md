# Overview

## Responsibilities

In line with our <a href="/company/values#together-we-thrive">Together we thrive</a> <a href="/company/values">value</a>, organization of key areas of the Meltano ecosystem are stewarded by Guilds.
Guilds are made up of members of the Meltano staff and contributers from the community.
Rather than owning the work items of a given area, Guilds perform an administration and coordination role.
Primary responsibilities are:

- Ownership, curation and dissemination of a roadmap (with guidance and support from Product, Data, Leadership, the Community, other Guilds etc.), especially for major version updates
- Ownership of community engagement (esp. the publishing/tagging of "Good First Issues" and participation in company events such as Taptoberfest)
- Ownership of key maintenance (releases, dependabot PRs, CI/CD workflows, PyPI publishing etc.)
- Ownership of slack, issue and PR triage (questions, bug reports, feature requests, community PR's etc.)
- Ownership of knowledge sharing and mentoring (promotion/improvement of Docs, Blog Posts, 'Best Practices', topics in Office Hours, Newsletters etc.)
- Ownership and development of domain tooling (e.g. `hub-utils`) as needed

## Expected Commitment

For Guilds to be self-sustaining, each are to have at least 2 permanent members (a HA pair ðŸ˜…).
Tenured engineers are encouraged to join a Guild and to work towards "subject matter expertise".
Newly hired engineers will likely be discouraged from Guild membership for a fixed period (say 6 months, TBD) so as not to specialize early or distract from onboarding.
Given the likely time commitment, engineers should be discouraged from joining multiple Guilds at our current company stage.
This can likely be relaxed as we grow ðŸš€

Each Guild might require different commitments of time and effort, but an 80/20 to 70/30 split is not unreasonable (with the majority chunk devoted to normal, non-Guild engineering responsibilities).

## Processes

Each Guild will be responsible for their own rituals, but some general expectations are set below:

- 30 minutes recurring calendar meeting
  - Can be cancelled if everything is done async
- GitHub project board that can be managed / updated async
- Ongoing google docs agenda that's updated before and after
- Fireflies ai in every meeting if they happen

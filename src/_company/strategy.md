This page highlights Meltano's most important strategic objectives, as a means for everyone in the company to align their efforts with important company-wide priorities. This gives teams a framework to contextualize and measure their contributions towards our stated objectives, and to determine the relative priority between different tasks to ensure that limited time is spent in the most impactful way.

## What is an OKR?

Every company defines and tracks OKRs differently. The common ground for any OKR framework is a focus on three core components:

1. **Objectives** - The priorities we need to achieve and the timeframe by which to achieve them.
2. **Key Results (KRs)** - The quantifiable measurements of success towards the stated objectives, tied to a specific timeframe of measurement.
3. **Initiatives** - Specific actions we can take which improve our KPI metrics and, in turn, help us reach our objectives.

## Current OKRs

These are our current OKRs, in order of importance. 
We aim to keep this list limited to 3 company-wide goals, and promote [future OKRs](#future-okrs) to current ones once an OKR as completed and a place opens up.

### OKR: Be the DataOps Platform Infrastructure

  - Coming soon, discussion [tracked here](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meta/-/issues/249).

## Future OKRs

These OKRs will become a priority once a [current OKR](#current-okrs) is completed and a place opens up.
Note that a small group of people (usually among the leadership team) may start doing preliminary work on these before they become a company-wide priority.

## Meltano's OKR Process

### Understanding Key Results and KPIs

We aim to have BI dashboards in Superset for each KPI that is connected to Key Results.
Where possible, we should have a dedicated dashboard page for each KR.
Charts and dashboards for KPIs should be linked back to the handbook and specific Goals where possible.

KRs are tracked in GitLab issues:

- KPI Name
- A KPI Goal title (e.g. "Improve Metric X")
- Start value
- Target value
- Timeframe for evaluation (e.g. "by July 10")
- Dashboard Link (if available)

KPI Goal tracking occurs in GitLab issues, with links to related Objectives and Initiatives via linked issues and/or via GitLab labels. The list of KRs is public and listed below under each OKR definition, including links to the GitLab issues with additional information.

### Tracking OKRs in GitHub

We track OKRs in GitHub as labels, using the format `OKR: Short Description`.

### Tracking related Initiatives in Gitlab

Initiatives impacting the OKR are tracked in GitHub and should be tagged with a label which associates the issue with the OKR it is targeted to help us achieve.

Note:

- OKR labels should be applied selectively, and only for those issues which are (1) prioritized to be built within the timeframe of the OKR, and (2) directly influencing a related Key Result.

### Transparency Guidelines for OKRs, KRs, and KPIs

- OKR definitions are **public** in the `handbook` repo ([above](#current-okrs)).
- Metric calculation logics are **public** in the [`squared`](https://gitlab.com/meltano/squared) repo and on the Data Team [KPIs](/data-team/kpis) handbook page.
- KR details, such as current metric values, goal targets, and metric history are kept **internal** by default, according to the guidelines on the [KPIs](/data-team/kpis#why-kpis-are-internal-by-default) page.
- If tracking a Key Result's status in GitLab issues, this tracking likewise occurs in **internal** GitLab issues.

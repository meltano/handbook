The Meltano Leadership team is:

- Douwe Maan, CEO
- AJ Steers, CTO
- Taylor Murphy, Head of Product & Data
- REB - Richard E. Baum, Head of Operations

The leadership team meets 2-4 times per month to have cross-functional discussions about how to best move the business forward.

Any changes (new processes, handbook updates) that impact all departments need to be discussed in at least one leadership call to make sure everyone is on board before getting merged.

Every Monday, leadership team members will post to `#internal-announcements` on what their departments are working on for the week to push the company priorities forward.

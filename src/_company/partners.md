We have four types of partners, tagged as such in HubSpot:

1. "Consultancy", e.g. Brooklyn Data Co. These are listed on https://meltano.com/partners/ and owned by Douwe.
2. "Built with Meltano", e.g. Matatika. These are owned by Product/Taylor
3. "Component Vendor", e.g. Lightdash. These are owned by Product/Taylor.
4. "Singer Working Group", e.g. Talend/Stitch. These are owned by Engineering/AJ.

Partners typically get a private Slack channel named `partner-<name>`.

## Adding New Partners

Partners can sign up via the [Meltano Partner Submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJUj7IHLKTV5vFxn8Xf5mSWtWpk7WU35LE0Ex3zfsyP8XO7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

When a new partner signs up, Douwe follows these steps:
- Add new partner to the website by following [these instructions](/marketing/wordpress#partners).
- Optionally create a private `partner-<name>` Slack channel and invite `meltano-team` and the partner's people.
- On the partner's HubSpot profile, set "Partner Type" and "Slack URL" as appropriate.

## Values

Our values define how we work together and make decisions.
They are Belief in better, Progress over perfection, Together we thrive, and Kindness is key.

You can learn more about these values on the [Values](values) page.

## Mission

Our mission is to **enable everyone to realize the full potential of their data**.

When we say “everyone”, we mean it. It includes massive enterprises, tiny startups, as well as individuals. It includes those who may one day pay us, as well as those who will likely never be able to. It includes solo founders, one-person IT/dev teams, and curious hobbyists, as well as multidisciplinary data teams and weathered veterans of the data profession.

Our core convictions fuel our mission:

- Data is a key ingredient for success in whatever goal one is trying to accomplish, both to identify the right problem to solve and to know you’re building the best solution,

- More accessible data tools that adapt to and scale with the unique needs of every team will accelerate innovation and progress in every aspect of the world, and

- The awesome power of data should be available to small upstarts with pure intentions just as much as it already is to massive organizations with their often muddled incentives and goals.

## Vision

Our vision is for Meltano to be **the foundation of every team's ideal data platform**.

More concretely, we are building **open source DataOps Platform Infrastructure** that will bring the benefits of software development best practices such as DevOps and open source to the entire data lifecycle.

## Persona and Problem

Our mission and vision are broad. To be able to achieve them, we must find product-market fit with a targeted profile of users so that we can build a sustainable business and continue to grow. 

Our target persona are mid- to senior-level Data Engineers who work for companies with 30-200 people and are likely the only data professional in their company.

The problem we are solving for them is that they are in the process of putting together a new data stack that will enable their organization to generate valuable insights, but they are dissatisfied with their previous experience and want a solution that addresses many of the problems they encountered as their previous platform attempted to change and grow. Their previous experience likely include:

* an inability to try new tools and difficulty in integrating them into their platform
* a lack of confidence when making any changes to the platform, particularly in GUI-based tools
* difficulties in deploying, managing, and integrating multiple disparate tools 
* a lack of control and insight into how their data platform truly works

This focus on a specific person and problem will enable us to have a clear [company strategy](/strategy) and [product roadmap](/product/roadmap).

## History

Meltano was [founded](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/01/hey-data-teams-we-are-working-on-a-tool-just-for-you/) inside [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) in 2018 as an open source tool built for GitLab’s data and analytics team, who wanted an end-to-end data platform built around open source components and DevOps principles.

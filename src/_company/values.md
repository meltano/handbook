Meltano’s core values are as follows:

- **Believe in better**

- **Progress over perfection**

- **Together we thrive**

- **Kindness is key**

## Believe in better
We have high aspirations and the drive to exceed them. We believe in impossible feats and imagine a better future. We’re determined to realize our goals and achieve strong results in everything we aim to accomplish.

We have a responsibility to ourselves, our teammates, and our community to do our best. We hold ourselves and each other to high standards, and we’re responsible for our work, words, and actions. We’re accountable for our mistakes and focus on learning from them and moving forward together.

## Progress over perfection
We work in small iterations so we can be efficient, add value quickly, and get feedback from the community. We have a bias toward action and continually improve our products and processes. We strive to be a net-positive company that makes net-positive actions. Every change should be towards making “the thing” a little bit better than the one that came before. Positive steps forward are the best way to achieve big goals. In practice, we ship minimum viable changes and seek to improve ourselves.

We maintain a measured mindset to continue to grow for years to come. We invest in our people, community, and products for the long term. We do this by putting family and friends first, being wise with resources, and not adopting a short-sighted point of view.

## Together we thrive
We recognize we are better as a collective, built-in the open and collaboratively. Diverse people, views, and approaches make the team and product better. We continually work to build a more diverse and inclusive community by hiring globally and creating a culture that supports team members everywhere.

We have an open-door policy where anyone can weigh in or question anything and learn about anything. We want to enable everyone to contribute, learn, and thrive.

We recognize that our vibrant community is at the core of Meltano. We will always keep the interests of our open source users and contributors in mind as we continue to grow.

## Kindness is key
We work with empathy, recognizing we’re not alone in this journey. We bring kindness, humility, trust, honesty, and an assumption of good faith to all of our interactions.
